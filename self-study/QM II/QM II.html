						<b>Chapter 1: Wave Mechanics</b>

The Schrodinger Equation
	<p>The quantum mechanical description of a system is given by the wavefunction &psi;. The evolution of the wavefunction is given by the Schrodinger equation i&hbar;(&part;&psi;/&part;)&Psi;(x,t) = ((-&hbar;<sup>2</sup>/2m)&part;<sup>2</sup>/&part;x<sup>2</sup> + V(x,t))&Psi;(x,t). Since this equation is first order in time, knowing the wavefunction at any point in time tells us the wavefunction at all times. Since it is linear, two solution wavefunctions can be added with complex coefficients to create a new solution. The physical interpretation of the wavefunction is that integrating the square of the norm over an interval is proportional to the probability of the particle being in that interval. A normalized wavefunction is a wavefunction multiplied by a constant such that this integral evaluated over all space gives 1.</p>

Stationary Solutions
	<p>i&hbar;(&part;&Psi;/&part;t)(x,t) = H&Psi;(x,t), where H is defined like so, is a shorter form of the Schrodinger equation. The stationary states of defined energy E can be found by taking &Psi;(x,t) = e<sup>-iEt/&hbar;</sup>&psi;(x). Substituting this partial solution into the Schrodinger equation gives H&psi;(x) = E&psi;(x). This is the time-independent Schrodinger equation; a solution correlated with an energy E is called an energy eigenstate, and if there is more than one possible solution for a given energy E the solutions are called degenerate. Although we require &psi; to be continuous and bounded and the derivative to be bounded, energy eigenstates <i>are</i> allowed to be non-normalizable. An energy eigenstate is called a bound state if &psi;(x) &rarr; 0 when |x| &rarr; &infin;. When the energy eigenstates are enumerable, they can be chosen to be orthonormal under the inner product given by &int;<sub>-&infin;</sub><sup>&infin;</sup>dx &psi;<sub>m</sub>*(x)&psi;<sub>n</sub>(x) = &delta;<sub>mn</sub> Furthermore, the set of energy eigenstates is complete - any other wavefunction can be expanded in a series of the energy eigenstates. Using this, we can define a given wavefunction &Psi;(x,0) = &sum;b<sub>n</sub>&psi;<sub>n</sub>(x) for any given time as &Psi;(x,t) = &sum;b<sub>n</sub>e<sup>-iE<sub>n</sub>t/&hbar;</sup>&psi;<sub>n</sub>(x). We can also find the coefficients b<sub>n</sub> = &int;dx &psi;<sub>n</sub>&(x)&psi;(x). If we substitute this into the expansion of &psi;(x) as a series and interchange the integral and sum operations, we get something like this: &psi;(x) = &int;dx' (&sum; &psi;<sub>n</sub>*(x')&psi;<sub>n</sub>(x))&psi;(x'); looking at f(x) = &int;dx' K(x',x)f(x') we know K(x',x) = &delta;(x - x').</p>

Properties of Energy Eigenstates in One Dimension
	<p>In one dimension, the energy eigenstates satisfy the following three properties, which can each be derived from the time-independent Schrodinger equation: first, bound states in one-dimensional potentials do not carry degeneracies. Second, the energy eigenstates can be chosen to be real. Third, if V(x) = V(-x) is even, then the eigenstates can be chosen to be either even or odd.</p>

The Nature of the Spectrum
	<p>The equation can be rewritten as &psi;'' = -k<sup>2</sup>(E - V(x))&psi;. We consider four cases of the potential. First, if V(x) is continuous then &psi; and its derivatives are continuous. Second, if V(x) has finite jumps &psi;'' has jumps but &psi;' is continuous. Third, if V(x) contains delta functions &psi;'' also will, and &psi;' will have jumps. Fourth, if V(x) has a hard wall &psi; will become identically zero in the interval covered by this wall, causing &psi;' to be discontinuous at the wall's boundary.</p>
	<p>Discrete and continuous spectrums can arise in several cases. First, for a finite well the spectrum is discrete and non-degenerate for energy levels below the potential walls. Second, for a finite wall on one side, the spectrum is continuous but non-degenerate. Third, for a central finite obstacle, the spectrum is not only continuous, but also doubly degenerate. For a sequence of discrete bounded &psi;<sub>n</sub> arranged by energy in ascending order, &psi;<sub>n</sub> will have <i>n</i> nodes.</p>

Variational Principle
	<p>It is possible to derive information about the ground state energy level without having to solve the Schrodinger equation. By taking an arbitrary (albeit normalized) wavefunction and calculating the expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator, we can put an upper bound on the energy of the ground state. Using the normalization formula, the least upper bound can be thought of as a functional across all possible normalizable wavefunctions; the minimum value of this functional over its domain gives us the least upper bound on the ground state energy.</p>

Position and Momentum
	<p>Since the position and momentum operators have nonzero commutator, we cannot have eigenstates of both simultaneously. The position operator (denoted by bold in this case) acts on the wavefunction like <b>x</b>&psi;(x) = x&psi;. The eigenstates of the position operator are &delta;(x-x<sub>0</sub>). The momentum operator in this representation is (&hbar;/i)&part;/&part;x, so the eigenstates are e<sup>ipx/&hbar;</sup>/(2&pi;&hbar;)<sup>1/2</sup>, which is a plane wave. Notice that neither of these are normalizable wavefunctions.</p>
	<p>These are each from the position point of view. We can also translate &psi; into the momentum space with a Fourier transform: &psi;(p) = &int;<sub>-&infin;</sub><sup>&infin;</sup>dx e<sup>-ipx/&hbar;</sup>&psi;(x)/(2&pi;&hbar;)<sup>1/2</sup>. In this space, acting the momentum operator on a wavefunction simply returns the wavefunction multiplied by momentum.</p>


<b>Chapter 2: Spin One-Half, Bras, Kets, and Operators</b>

The Stern-Gerlach Experiment
	<p>The Stern-Gerlach experiment showed electrons have a two-valued quantized magnetic moment. Intuitively, this is caused by the electrons' intrinsic self-rotation or "spin", which is valued at 1/2. On a closed loop, the magnetic moment vector is proportional to the current in the loop and the vector area of the loop. A spinning charge distribution causes a magnetic moment and angular momentum; I = Qv/2&pi;R. The relationship between the dipole moment and angular momentum L is &micro; = (Q/2M)L.</p>
	<p>Electrons don't exactly fit this picture. They are elementary particles; they aren't extensive - just points. However, despite our intuition, this picture <i>does</i> lead to the right results. &micro; = (e/2m<sub>e</sub>)S, where the spin S stands in for the angular momentum L. In the actual formula we use, S/&hbar; is used because spin and angular momentum should have the same units. Experimentally, we know that &micro; = g(e&hbar;/2m<sub>e</sub>)(S/&hbar;), where the g-factor is g=2 in the case of the electron. This g-factor is explained by relativistic quantum mechanics by the Dirac equation. The magnetic moment and angular momentum point in the same direction, inverted by the negative charge on the electron. &micro;=-g&micro;<sub>B</sub>S/&hbar;, where the vector form of S is used. The force on the dipole also points in the same direction as the gradient of the dot product between &micro; and B; so, if we choose the magnetic field to point up through a loop with a counterclockwise current, the dipole will experience a force in the z direction proportional to the z-component of its magnetic moment. The Stern-Gerlach apparatus measured this effect on silver atoms, for which the deflection in a magnetic field separated the atoms into a distribution with two equidistant peaks. This is consistent with S<sub>z</sub>/&hbar;=&plusmn;1/2.</p>
	<p>Suppose we have a machine that can filter the particles by sorting them into spin up and spin down in a given direction. A setup which takes only the spin-up particles in the z direction, then only the spin-down particles in the x direction, and finally re-sorts the particles will result in two equally dense beams of particles. The point made here is, the first filtering is annulled by the second filtering; this goes against classical expectations.</p>

Spin One-Half States & Operators
	<p>The mathematical language for describing this physical system is in terms of basis vectors (referred to as kets), either |z;+&rang; or |Z;-&rang;. The spin operator in the z direction S<sub>z</sub> should act on these states and return those same states multiplied by &plusmn;&hbar;/2. Our wavefunction is then also a vector in the vector space generated by |z;+&rang; and |z;-&rang; under the complex numbers. The states can be translated into column vectors: |z:+&rang; = (1, 0)<sup>T</sup>. We also have the dual versions of these, denoted <i>bras</i>. With state |&alpha;&rang; = &alpha;<sub>1</sub>|+&rang; + &alpha;<sub>2</sub>|-&rang;, &lang;&alpha| =  &alpha;<sub>1</sub>*&lang;1| + &alpha;<sub>2</sub>*&lang;-| = (&alpha;<sub>1</sub>*, &alpha;<sub>2</sub>*). The bra-ket inner product is defined as the matrix product of the row vector and the column vector. So, based on the vector format we can define the operator S<sub>z</sub> as the matrix (&hbar;/2)((1,0),(0,-1)). </p>
	<p>By restricting the other spin operators to be Hermitian, we can determine their forms based on the definition of a Hermitian matrix: ((2c, a-ib),(a+ib, 2d)). By removing the parts of the matrix proportional to S<sub>z</sub>, we are left with an entirely real component and an entirely complex component. Separating these, we have the forms for the matrices of S<sub>x</sub> = ((0,1),(1,0)) and S<sub>y</sub> ((0,-i),(i,0)). These three matrices are the Pauli matrices, and they also satisfy the commutation relations expected of angular momentum. The eigenfunctions of the S<sub>x</sub> and S<sub>y</sub> operators are superpositions of the two eigenfunctions of the S<sub>z</sub> operator.</p>
	<p>The full spin operator S can b written as (&hbar;/2)&sigma;, where &sigma; is simply the Pauli matrices arranged into a 'vector' of matrices. Then the spin operator in a direction given by the unit vector <b>n</b> is S<sub>n</sub>=<b>n</b>&sdot;S. Then the formulae for the eigenstates of S<sub>n</sub> in terms of the z-states are as follows: |n;+&rang; = cos(&theta;/2)|+&rang; + e<sup>i&phi;</sup>sin(&theta;/2)|-&rang; and |n;-&rang; = e<sup>-i&phi;</sup>sin(&theta;/2)|-&rang; + cos(&theta;/2)|-&rang;</p>

<b>Chapter 3: Vector Spaces and Operators</b>
	<p>Much of this material is covered in introductory courses on linear algebra. However, our purposes require a modification for the extension to complex vector spaces. The inner product is a generalization of the dot product such that &lang;v,v&rang;>=0, &lang;v,v&rang;=0 implies v=0, &lang;u,a+b&rang; = &lang;u,a&rang;+&lang;u,b&rang;, &lang;u,&alpha;v&rang;=&alpha;&lang;u,v&rang;, &lang;u,v&rang;=&lang;v,u&rang;*. The norm |v| is redefined in terms of a given inner product to be |v|<sup>2</sup> = &lang;v,v&rang;. Notice that this definition works for the conventional dot product and norms for the familiar real vector spaces, since conjugation does nothing to a real number.</p>
	<p>A major idea is that of the adjoint of an operator T, denoted T&dagger;, where &lang;u,TV&rang;=&lang;T<sup>&dagger;</sup>u,v&rang;. A linear functional is a map from a vector space to the field the space is under. Linear functionals are, of course, linear. They are also homogenous under multiplication by elements in the field. Curiously enough, any given linear functional &Phi; can be written in the form &Phi;(v) = &lang;u,v&rang; for some u. Then &lang;u,Tv&rang;=&lang;w,v&rang;, and T<sup>&dagger;</sup> is essentially the operator such that w = T<sup>&dagger;</sup>u.</p>
	<p>Hermitian operators are those operators such that T=T<sup>&dagger;</sup>. This is true if and only if &lang;v,Tv&rang; is real for all v. This implies the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are not only real, but also orthogonal. Another special type of operator is unitary operators. These are operators that do not change the magnitude of vectors: |Uv|=|v|. This also implies U<sup>-1</sup>=U<sup>&dagger;</sup>. U maps orthonormal bases to orthonormal bases, and its matrix elements in those orthonormal bases are the same.</p>

<b>Chapter 4: Dirac's Bra and Ket Notation</b>
	<p>Essentially the bra-ket notation translation looks like this: &lang;u,v&rang;=&lang;u|v&rang;. Inner products are split into bra-ket pairs as discussed earlier. Bras are represented by vectors, and kets are represented with dual vectors. Just like vectors can be written as linear combinations of a basis, the bras can be written as linear superpositions like v=&sum;e<sub>i</sub>&lang;e<sub>i</sub>|v&rang;=&sum;|i&rang;&lang;i|v&rang;.</p>
	<p>A linear operator &Omega;:V&rarr;V in the bra-ket notation is essentially the object |a&rang;&lang;b|. It acts on bras from the right and kets from the left. Since it is a linear transformation, it should have a matrix in a given basis. Given a basis, denoted as |e<sub>i</sub>&rang=|i&rang;, we can define the matrix elements as &Omega;<sub>mn</sub>=&lang;m|&Omega;|n&rang;. Then &Omega;=&sum;<sub>m,n</sub>|m&rang;&Omega;<sub>mn</sub>&lang;n|.</p>
	<p>In terms of Hermitian operators, the operators associated with observables, Hermiticity implies the following: &lang;v|&Omega;|u&rang;=&lang;u|&Omega;|v&rang;* and &lang;u|v&rang;=&lang;u|&Omega;v&rang;. In terms of unitary operators, those where the adjoint is the inverse, their key property is the preservation of the norms of states. In general, &lang;Ua|Ub&rang; = &lang;a|b&rang;. Based on these facts, it can be shown that U maps orthonormal bases to orthonormal bases. This fact can be rewritten as the fact that any unitary operator U can be rewritten as U = &sum;|b<sub>i</sub>&rang;&lang;a<sub>i</sub>| for some orthonormal bases |a<sub>n</sub>&rang; and |b<sub>n</sub>&rang;.</p>
	<p>A basis can also be uncountable, as is the case for position and momentum states. For position, the basis states are |x&rang;, where the label isn't a vector. In three dimensions, the label would be a three-dimensional vector while the ket itself is an infinite dimensional complex vector. Back to the one-dimensional case, the inner product is defined as &lang;x|y&rang;=&delta;(x-y). For the basis of states to be complete, we require that <b>1</b> = &int;dx|x&rang;&lang;x|. A state |&psi;(x)&rang; of a particle in the position wavefunction point of view looks like so: &psi;(x)=&lang;x|&psi;&rang;. All the relationships for x are also analogously true for the momentum p. &lang;x|p&rang;=(2&pi;&hbar;)<sup>-1/2</sup>e<sup>ipx/&hbar</sup> is the wavefunction of a particle with momentum p in the position representation.</p>

<b>Chapter 5: Uncertainty Principle and Compatible Observables</b>

Uncertainty Defined
	<p>In statistics, not just the mean/average value is considered, but also the variance in that value. Here, we don't just consider the expectation value &lang;A&rang; of a Hermitian operator A, but also the uncertainty &Delta;A(&Psi;). The expectation value and uncertainty in the bra-ket notation are defined as &lang;A&rang;=&lang;&Psi;|A|&Psi;&rang;=&lang;&Psi;,A&Psi;&rang;. &Delta;A(&Psi;)=|(A-&lang;A&rang;I)&Psi;|. Squaring and reducing this expression leads to (&Delta;A(&Psi;))<sup>2</sup> = &lang;A<sup>2</sup>&rang;-&lang;A&rang;<sup>2</sup>. </p>

The Uncertainty Principle
	<p>The uncertainty principle sets a lower bound on the product of uncertainties of two Hermitian operators. (&Delta;A)<sup>2</sup>(&DeltaB;)<sup>2</sup> >= (&lang;&Psi;|(1/2i)[A,B]|&Psi;&rang;)<sup>2</sup>.</p>

Energy-Time Uncertainty
	<p>Energy and time also have an uncertainty principle, &Delta;E&Delta;t&gap;&hbar;. Based on the uncertainty principle, we can use A:=H and B:=Q for the Hamiltonian and some arbitrary operator Q; Q itself should have no time dependence. By differentiating &lang;Q&rang; with respect to time and substituting the Schrodinger equation, we can get d(&lang;Q&rang;)/dt = (i/&hbar;)&lang;[H,Q]&rang;. The physical implications of this statement are that an operator corresponds to a conserved quantity if it commutes with the Hamiltonian operator. We can substitute this result back into the uncertainty inequality for &Delta;H&Delta;Q >= (&hbar;/2)|d&lang;Q&rang;/dt|. The time for appreciable change in the expectation value of Q can be approximated as &Delta;Q/|d&lang;Q&rang;/dt|, leading to the inequality &Delta;H&Delta;t<sub>Q</sub>>=&hbar;/2. Back to the topic of energy uncertainty, if H is time independent, then it is easily shown from the commutator relationship that &Delta;H is also constant in time.</p>

Lower Bounds for Ground State Energies
	<p>While the variational principle is useful for finding upper bounds, the uncertainty principle is useful for finding lower bounds on the energy of the ground state in one dimension. The key here is that momentum expectation value is 0, causing us to be able to substitute &lang;p<sup>2</sup>&rang;=(&Delta;p)<sup>2</sup> in the ground state. The procedure involves taking the expectation value of both sides of the Hamiltonian formula, substituting for the aforementioned momentum relationship, and minimizing the right-hand side with respect to &Delta;x. </p>

Diagonalization of Operators
	<p>A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has a set of eigenvectors that span the vector space. Given a linear operator T, if there exists a change-of-basis operator A such that T is diagonal in the new basis given by A, then T is diagonalizable. As it turns out, the k-th column of A is the k-th eigenvector of T. Fortunately, the Hermitian and Unitary operators can be diagonalized. Furthermore, they are unitarily diagonalizable; that is, the matrix is diagonalized in an orthonormal basis.</p>

Spectral Theorem
	<p>Unitary and Hermitian operators are special cases of normal operators, or operators that commute with their adjoints. The Spectral Theorem states that a matrix is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if it is normal. The proof of this theorem is by induction, where an eigenvector of the matrix M is selected, a unitary matrix is built with the orthonormal basis generated by this eigenvector, and it is applied to make M diagonalized in the first row/column pair. Then the sub matrix is a matrix of size n-1, and is therefore unitarily diagonalizable. The converse is easily proved through the definition of normality.</p>
