						<b>Section 1: Key Features of Quantum Mechanics</b>

							<p>This lecture introduces the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Dr. Zwiebach gives a brief history  of quantum physics, then gives a quick preview of the following lecture: first, linearity of the theory will be discussed, then the necessity of complex numbers, then photons and polarization, loss of determinism, and finally superposition.
							</p><p>The first section discusses linearity; in order to do this, basic background on linearity/nonlinearity of theories is needed. Essentially, if we have two solutions to a linear theory, then we can create a third solution by adding them together - such as with Maxwell's electromagnetism. The linearity of electromagnetism can be seen from Maxwell's wave equations, which are linear differential equations. By a comparison, general relativity and classical mechanics are nonlinear theories; conclusions evidenced by the nonlinearity of their corresponding equations. For quantum mechanics, the governing equation (Schrodinger's) is linear, giving rise to an inherently linear theory. Based on the given definition of a linear operator, and the fact that Schrodinger's equation can be put into the form L(psi) = 0, it is shown that the equation is linear.
							</p><p>Dr. Zwiebach claims quantum mechanics is the first theory making meaningful use of complex numbers. Although complex numbers are used in other theories, they are typically "auxiliary" - that is, they may appear during calculations, but only temporarily, never as the final answer. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, uses complex numbers much more directly. Since the wavefunction itself is complex, we cannot measure it directly because our measurements must be real; therefore, we can only measure the wavefunction indirectly.
							</p><p>Quantum mechanics also comes with a loss of determinism; I did not expect this to be derived from the concepts of photons. As is explained, physicists came to realize, through observing phenomena such as the photelectric effect, that light can act as a wave and as a particle. However, if we pass a beam of light consisting of identical photons (a laser) through a polarizer, some particles are absorbed while others are not; parts of particles are not absorbed because the light exiting the polarizer is of the same frequency. We cannot tell beforehand which photons will be absorbed, meaning we cannot reliably predict the system's behavior with certainty. That is, the present does not necessarily determine the future.
							</p><p>Next, superposition in quantum mechanics was discussed. Since this is a linear theory, adding two possible states together gives another possible reality allowed by the theory. The first example used to demonstrate superposition is the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. With a specific configuration, there is an interference effect at BS2 which leads to a full beam at D0, but no beam at D1. However, since two photons should not interfere to give zero photons (where would the energy go?), this can only be interpreted as a photon interfering with itself; it takes both paths through the interferometer simultaneously. Furthermore, using the state-based description of photon polarization - a|photon; x> + b|photon; y>, a,b complex - it can be shown that this corresponds to two real parameters, the same degrees of freedom as classical mechanics. A similar superposition effect can be seen in electron spin. As electrons can be spin up or spin down in a chosen direction, electrons with unknown spin direction are in a superposition of the two states - they are spinning up and down simultaneously.
							</p><p>Finally, quantum entanglement is introduced. Quantum entanglement can occur when states of two or more particles are considered. When two particles are being considered, we can write a state of two particles as a tensor product of the individual states. The state of the two particle system can be described with superpositions of these products. If we can factor these superpositions such that the first factor is all of one particle, and the other factor is states from only the second particle, then the system can be specified by the states of the individual particles.</p>

						<b>Section 2</b>
							<p>Having acquired a broad overview of quantum physics, the next lecture seeks to dive deeper into the Mach-Zehder Interferometer. By learning more about the interferometer, we can build on what we've learned from the last lecture while also displaying more of the whacky qualities of quantum physics. As before, the diagram shows the configuration for the interferometer, with two beam splitters, two mirrors, and two detectors.
							</p><p>At any x position of the diagram, a photon can either be in the top beam or the bottom beam; this means the state can be written as a vector [a, b] where aa* + bb* = 1; the norms squared correspond to probabilities of being found on the top (a) or bottom (b). When a photon hits a beam splitter, it is transformed according to whether it hit the BS from the top or the bottom; the mathematical effect is multiplying the vector by a matrix [[s, u], [t, v]]. Since we want to keep probabilities normalized, the sum of square norms of entries down each column have to add up to one; this restricts each entry to be +/- 1/sqrt(2). Based on the results the possible matrices give, BS1 and BS2 correspond to matrices where s and v are negative, respectively. Using this matrix representation, we see that blocking the bottom path with an absorbing block will lead to a probability of 1/4 that the photon reaches the lower detector; this is increased from the zero it was.
							</p><p>As an example of an application, Dr. Zwiebach introduces the concept of an Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb, which is a bomb with a photon detector for an activation trigger. If we were to classically test the trigger mechanism for viability, this would involve exploding the bomb; this would undermine our goal. However, if we use the bomb's photon detector in place of the absorbing block in the above setup, there will be 1/4 probability of the photon ending on the bottom detector without exploding the bomb. By contrast, if the photon detector is not working and allows the photon through, the only possibility is for the photon to end on the top detector. Therefore, if we test the detector and a photon ends up on the bottom, then we know the detector is working; otherwise, if the photons end up on the top detector every time, the detector is not working. Theoretically, we could imagine a system in which the probability of the photon ending up on the bottom without a corresponding explosion is much higher than with an explosion, allowing us to detect viable bombs with high efficiency and low risk of loss.
							</p><p>This phenomenon is called an interaction-free measurement, which does not occur in classical systems and is further evidence supporting quantum theory.</p>

						<b>Section 3</b>
							<p>This lecture further discusses wave-particle duality, beginning with the photoelectric effect and moving on to discuss Compton scattering and matter waves.
							</p><p>The photoelectric effect is the phenomenon where light causes metal to emit electrons, causing a photoelectric current. There were, however, some observations that puzzled physicists at the time: below a threshold frequency, there is no current, the magnitude of the current is proportional to intensity of the light, and the energy of the electrons is not related to the intensity of the light. Previously, physicists knew how this process works at high wavelengths; these laws broke down for shorter wavelengths because their predictions resulted in the "ultraviolet catastrophe." Fortunately, the concept of photons as discrete particles of light explains the photoelectric effect.
							</p><p>If the work required to eject an electron is W, and the energy of a photon is hv, then the kinetic energy of the electron is the difference between the two: E = hv - W. After a dimensional analysis, we can see that [h] = [E/v] = LML/T, or length times momentum. We can use this to construct a length quantity attributed to a given massive particle by taking the momentum as mc, then dividing h/p to get the Compton wavelength. Since we used v = c, this corresponds to a photon with energy equal to the rest energy of the given particle.
							</p><p>Relativistically speaking, the equation E^2 - (pc)^2 = (mc^2)^2 governs the relationship between energy, momentum, and rest mass. For a photon, we have E = pc; combined with E = hv we get p = h/lambda. Under Thomson (classical) scattering, light rebounding off electrons will result in light of the same frequency; by comparison, experimental results show that the wavelength changes. With the concept of photons, this makes sense: by energy/momentum conservation, entire photons cannot be absorbed, but photons must lose some energy to the electrons (changing the wavelength).
							</p><p>Using Compton's ideas, Louis de Broglie hypothesized that the equation for wavelength, h/p, could be extended to all particles. The idea that particles are also waves hints at interesting effects: waves diffract/interfere. It makes sense that we don't observe many of these effects in our physical world, because our length scales are very large; by comparison, h seems to approach 0, and so does the wavelength. This would imply that quantum effects tend to become negligible at large length scales.</p>

						<b>Section 4</b>
							<p>To any free particle we can now associate a matter wave with the de Broglie wavelength. This wave is called the wavefunction of the particle. In classical mechanics, we know our laws should be invariant under a Galilean transformation. However, changing Galilean frames does not preserve quantum wavelength as it would for a normal wave. Therefore, since wavefunctions aren't necessarily frame-invariant, they cannot be measured in different frames with the same result: they are not directly measurable.
							</p><p>If we form a packet of waves, where the function {phi}(k) is multiplying the wavefunctions exp(i(kx - w(k) t)) through an integration over k, we can imagine the function phi as having a peak around k = K0. Then taking {psi}(x,t) and substituting a first order expansion of w(k) about K0 gives us a phase factor multiplied by an integral. This integral can be rewritten as {psi}(x - dw/dk | K0 * t, 0). Taking the absolute value removes the phase factor. Suppose the packet peaks at some point x = X0. Then we can set it equal to the x value passed into {psi} for the previous expression, getting x = x0 + vt, where v is dw/dk evaluated at K0. So, the wave packet can be thought of as moving with this velocity of the peak.
							 </p><p>Then, Dr. Zwiebach moves on to discuss the wavefunction for a free particle. Based on the de Broglie relations, we have a couple options for forming superpositions, those being sine, cosine, and exponentials. Since sine and cosine superpositions will all vanish identically at certain times, exponential superpositions are the only ones that make sense. As a matter of convention, physicists choose a positive time dependence to get {psi}(x, t) = exp(i(k*x - wt)) for the free particle wavefunction. With this wavefunction, p = hk and E = hw.</p>

						<b>Section 5</b>
							<p>Excitingly, we discovered the wave function of a free particle! In quantum theory, the wavefunction is meant to be the most complete description of a system available; to get information from the wavefunction, we use operators to act on them. In the case of momentum, we can get the momentum by taking the derivative with respect to x and multiplying by h/i, leaving the wavefunction multiplied by the value of the momentum. The action we've performed is called an operator, and if we analogize the operator to a matrix, then the equivalent of the constant is an eigenvalue. Not all wavefunctions are eigenvalues, because not all states have defined momentum. Therefore, in correlation with an eigenvector, we call our particular {psi} an eigenstate of momentum.
							</p><p>Similarly, we can construct an operator for the energy of a state. The operator ih*d/dt accomplishes this, but so does the operator p^2 /2m, which simplifies to E = -hh/2m * d^2/dx^2. Acting these two operators on the wavefunction and setting them equal gives the Schrodinger equation for a free particle wavefunction. Notice that adding two solutions with different k's creates a superposition that is also a solution; yet, acting with the momentum operator does not produce an eigenvalue.
							</p><p>However, if we want to include particles in potentials, we will need to alter the Schrodinger equation to do so. If E = pp/2m + V(x,t), then we simply substitute this in for the energy operator in the Schrodinger equation. The new energy operator, including potential energy, is called the Hamiltonian operator. The full Schrodinger equation can be written as ih d/dt {psi} = H{psi}. Notice that the equation is only first order in time, so the wavefunction at any specific instant in time will also determine it for the future. Additionally, the function is linear, allowing superpositions to work.
							</p><p>We've been introducing a number of different operators. Notice that each of these operators is linear - that is, they are distributive over addition as well as associative. Furthermore, we can construct the commutator of two different operators [A, B] = AB - BA. For example, [p, x] = ih. This builds further on the correspondence between QM concepts and linear systems; interestingly, an entirely different viewpoint of QM, called the Heisenburg picture can be constructed from this correspondence.
							</p><p>The Schrodinger equation can be extended to multiple dimensions by adding corresponding components to the differential operators. If we do this, we can see that coordinate and momentum operators will commute if they act on different position variables.
							</p><p>Ultimately, the wavefunction needs an interpretation; we need to understand the physical meaning of it. The answer is that the wavefunction represents the probability of a particle; integrating the square norm of the wavefunction over a space interval will give the probability of measuring the particle to be in that region.</p>
