						<p>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an undergrad at the Raikes School at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. I grew up in Thurston, NE
						and attended high school in Pender, NE. As a kid in a rural community, I had the opportunity to challenge myself by
						self-studying the upper levels of my favorite fields. I was ever curious, causing me to push to acquire knowledge,
						 skills, and experiences far outside the box.
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my experiences, I've managed to pick up some technical skills, including programming languages.
							Currently, my languages include Java, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among others. I've even built some cool
							projects, some of which you will find on this site.
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm involved in a variety of activities here on campus, including the Honors Student Advisory Board,
							the Kauffman Residents Association, and ASUN Student Government. I'm also looking forward to doing research with Dr. Huijing Du
							in mathematical biology and Dr. Alex Zupan in knot theory. Through all these projects, I hope to apply my knowledge
							and technical skills to positively impact the world around me.
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first ever Presidential Scholar of UNL, I have finally attained the freedom to pursue my interests 
							at my own discretion. The difficulty with having many interests is having many choices. Although I haven't yet determined 
							what my career path will look like, I know I want to make a positive impact on the world around me.
